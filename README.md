# Rubik-s-cube-A.I.-solver
IMPORTANT:
1. Do not try and press 1 button twice while the cube is working, it will break everything
1,1. If it locks in an infinite loop or breaks kill the terminal or cmd
2. If it desnt solve just press the solver again
3. It still has a lot of bugs
4. After each solve the console tels you how long it took to solve the cube in seconds. My recrd is 0.2 seconds 
5. For the code to run corectly you will have to install folowing modules:
  -VPython    #for 3D animations
  -Random    #for scrumbling
  -time      #for measuring time and slowing down the cube
